My Client Wants

Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $250/hr to build a site with the following requirements.

A large, skeuomorphic header.
A 2 column layout with the leftmost column as a nav.
A short navbar which is always collapsed and slides down to reveal four items
Lots of animated gifs
Quite a few ways to get to the product page, sprinkled throughout the site.
A footer with copyright information and a nice picture of the founder.
Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
